## Introduction

This is a tool for developers or admins who want to migrate the issue management for their software project from Bugzilla to Gitlab Issues. Here is a screenshoot of an issue created by bugzilla2gitlab:
![bugzilla2gitlab created issue](snapshot.png)

bugzilla2gitlab copies over bugs, bug comments and attachments.

## Installation

This library is very much under development. That said, if you like to feel the wind in your hair, simply `pip install bugzilla2gitlab`.

More than likely, you will need to roll up your sleaves and hack on the package to achieve a migration that you are happy with. In this case:

```
git clone git@github.com:xmunoz/bugzilla2gitlab.git
cd bugzilla2gitlab
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# installs this package locally
pip install .
```

bugzilla2gitlab is compatible with python3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

## Usage

bugzilla2gitlab synchronously migrates a user-defined list of bugzilla bugs to a single GitLab project. There are two interfaces for this library. The command line usage:

```
$  bin/bugzilla2gitlab -h
usage: bugzilla2gitlab [-h] [FILE] [CONFIG_DIRECTORY]

Migrate bugs from Bugzilla to GitLab Issues.

positional arguments:
  [FILE]              A file containing a list of Bugzilla bug numbers to
                      migrate, one per line.
  [CONFIG_DIRECTORY]  The directory containing the required configuration
                      files.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
```

This package can also be used as a python module.

```
from bugzilla2gitlab import Migrator

client = Migrator(config_path="/path/to/config")
bugs_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
client.migrate(bugs_list)
```

## Configuration

To begin using bugzilla2gitlab, the following list of configuration files is required in the specified `config` directory:

- `defaults.yml`: Core default values used throughout the modules.

Samples of all of these files with documentation for each configuration variable can be found in `tests/test_data/config`.

The default table created in the issue description by bugzilla2gitlab looks like this:

## How it works

### GitLab

Gitlab has a comprehensive and extensively documented API. Here are the main endpoints that this library makes use of.

- [Creating new issues](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/issues.html#new-issue)
- [Adding comments to issues](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/notes.html)
- [Uploading files](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/projects.html#upload-a-file)
- [Changing an issue status](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/issues.html#edit-issue)
- [Getting user ids](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/users.html#for-admins)

### Bugzilla

This program relies on being able to fetch bug data by simply appending `&ctype=xml` to the end of the bugzilla bug url, and then parsing the resultant xml. If this trick doesn't work on your bugzilla installation, then bugzilla2gitlab probably won't work for you.

## Caveats

Every comment or mention in GitLab typically sends a notification. This is true even for comments/issues created programatically. To avoid users inboxes being flooded with meaningless email notifications and avoid overwhelming your SMTP servers, GitLab users should disable all email notifications (global and group-specific) just prior to the running of this script. This can be done through the [gitlab UI](https://gitlab.com/profile/notifications).

The script attempts to import issues into Gitlab using the same timestamp and bug numbers as returned by Bugzilla. However, this will only work if the Gitlab user performing the API calls has administrator access, or has group/project ownership. Otherwise, this information will be silently lost. Additionally, it is unknown what happens when there are conflicting issue numbers in Gitlab already, so it's best to start with no existing issues.

## Demo

If you want to test out this library on a non-production GitLab instance, I recommend starting up a [one-click GitLab droplet from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/features/one-click-apps/gitlab/). From there, you can create a code repository, add some user accounts, and take bugzilla2gitlab for a spin.
